#utils

Utils is providing constants and functions for the App.

- constants: It is a single file that tend to provide a big object containing all
  the constants needed through its fields.
  Here we want to limit the use of variables to decrease the javascript global variable
  performance issue.

- functions: It is a collection of files that defined functions used in the App.
  In order of readablility we define one file for one function.
